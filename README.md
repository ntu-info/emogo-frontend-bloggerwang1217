# Expo Router Minimal Working Example

An experience-sampling mobile app that collects multimodal emotional data through daily check-ins. Inspired by the "Emotions on the Go" study from University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## App URI

🚀 **Expo Go URI:** `exp://[your-expo-url]`

📱 **QR Code:** Scan with Expo Go app

*Note: The app URI will be available after running `npx expo start` and publishing to Expo.*

## Project Description

**I'm Emo Now** is a React Native mobile application built with Expo that helps users track their emotional states throughout the day. The app prompts users three times daily to:

- **Rate their emotions** on a 1-5 scale using an interactive emoji slider
- **Record a 1-second vlog** capturing their emotional state visually
- **Automatically capture GPS coordinates** of their location during check-in

All data is stored locally on the device and can be exported as a CSV file for analysis.

### Design Philosophy

The app features an **"Atmospheric Sci-Fi"** design system inspired by the Flexoki and One Hunter color palettes:

- **Minimalist & Introspective:** Clean, focused interface without distractions
- **Dark Theme:** Inky dark backgrounds with soft, desaturated colors
- **Text-Centric:** Clear typography using the Inter font family
- **Subtle Interactions:** Minimal animations and elegant transitions

## Features

### Core Functionality

✅ **Emotion Questionnaire**
- 5-point emotion scale with emoji slider (😢 😟 😐 😊 😄)
- Visual, touch-friendly interface
- Single emotion score (1-5) stored per session

✅ **1-Second Vlog Recorder**

2. Scroll through your past entries
3. Pull down to refresh the list
4. Tap the trash icon to delete an entry

### Exporting Data

1. Open the **History** screen
2. Tap **"Export Data (CSV)"**
3. Choose where to share the data (email, cloud storage, etc.)
4. Videos are stored separately in your camera roll

### Settings

1. **Enable/Disable Notifications:** Toggle the switch
2. **Customize Times:** Tap on each time slot to change notification times
3. **Save Settings:** Tap "Save Times" after making changes
4. **Test Notifications:** Send a test notification to verify setup

## H-AI Interaction History

This project was developed with assistance from Claude AI (Anthropic). The interaction history has been documented and is available in the repository under `H-AI-INTERACTION.md`.

Key areas where AI assistance was utilized:
- Architecture planning and project structure
- SQLite database design and implementation
- Navigation setup with Expo Router
- Design system implementation
- Code review and optimization
- Debugging and error handling

## Sample Data

Sample data exports are available in the `/data` folder:
- 3+ emotion questionnaire responses
- 3+ GPS coordinate records
- Time span: > 12 hours between first and last entry

Videos are stored in the device camera roll and referenced by timestamp in the CSV export.

## Development Timeline

- **Phase 1-2:** Project setup and emotion UI (3 hours)
- **Phase 3-4:** Camera and GPS implementation (4 hours)
- **Phase 5:** Notifications system (2 hours)
- **Phase 6:** History screen (2 hours)
- **Phase 7:** Data export (2 hours)
- **Phase 8:** UI/UX polish (2 hours)
- **Phase 9:** Testing and data collection (12+ hours)
- **Phase 10:** Documentation (1 hour)

**Total:** ~28 hours including real-world testing

## Known Issues

- Camera recording may require device restart after first permission grant on some Android devices
- iOS simulator does not support camera, must test on physical device
- Notification delivery reliability varies by device/OS settings

## Future Enhancements

### More Input Variables (More Xs)
- Additional emotion dimensions (arousal, dominance)
- Contextual questions (activity, social context)
- Voice memo option
- Photo capture of environment
- Weather data integration
- Step count/movement data

### Better Analysis (Better Ys)
- Data visualization dashboard
- Emotion trends over time
- Location-based emotion patterns
- Time-of-day analysis
- Weekly/monthly reports
- Cloud backup and sync
- Multi-user support for research studies
